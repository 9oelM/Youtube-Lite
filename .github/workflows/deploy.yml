# Since Github actions is not good at previewing a 'test merge' at all,
# we use CircleCi for that. This worflow is only meant to run when 
# merge to actual dev and prod branches happen.
# why operate on two different platforms? CircleCI can do the job,
# and it offers limited free credits every week. To save those,
# all other actions that can be run on Github should be run through Github Actions.
